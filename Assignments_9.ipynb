    "Ans:-  Python 3.X's string types share almost all the same operations. Method calls, sequence operations, and even larger tools like pattern matching work the same way. On the other hand, only str supports string formatting operations, and bytearray has an additional set of operations that perform in-place changes. The str and bytes types also have methods for encoding and decoding text, respectively."

    "Ans:- In 3.X, text-mode files assume their file content is Unicode text (even if it's ASCII) and automatically decode when reading and encode when writing. With binarymode files, bytes are transferred to and from the file unchanged. The contents of text-mode files are usually represented as str objects in your script, and the contents of binary files are represented as bytes (or bytearray) objects."

You can also read in binary mode and manually decode the bytes to a string by giving an encoding name, but this involves extra work and is somewhat error-prone for multibyte characters."

    "Ans:- The impact of Python 3.X's string types change depends upon the types of strings you use. For scripts that use simple ASCII text, there is probably no impact at all. The str string type works the same in 2.6 and 3.X in this case. Moreover, although string-related tools in the standard library such as re, struct, pickle, and xml may technically use different types in 3.X than in 2.6, the changes are largely irrelevant to most programs because 3.X's str and bytes and 2.6's str support almost identical interfaces. If you process Unicode data, the toolset you need has simply moved from 2.6's unicode and codecs.open() to 3.X's str and open. If you deal with binary data files, you'll need to deal with content as bytes objects; since they have a similar interface to 2.6 strings, though, the impact should again be minimal."
